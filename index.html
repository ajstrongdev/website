      Hiya! I'm AJ! Welcome to my little home on the internet, where I like to show off the things I create. I sometimes write as well. I am a GNU/Linux enthusiast as well as the Founder and Desktop Lead of <a href="https://rhinolinux.org" target="_blank" class="text-dracula-green">Rhino Linux</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-white mt-4 text-xl">
      I'm a software developer and information activist, I seek to promote accessible, reliable information about free and open source software in my blog posts and write-ups. I am 18 years old, and I am very passionate about computers and technology.
    </p>
    <p class="text-white mt-4 text-xl">
      I first started learning website development in 2017 from school and fell in love with programming, from there I began to teach myself as much as I could. I was introduced to GNU/Linux and open source software in August 2020 and swapped from Windows 10 to Linux full-time in October 2020. I fell in love with open source software and the philosophy behind it.
