            <span>Hello</span>, I'm AJ! This is my little home on the internet where I like to show off things I have created! I am a GNU/Linux enthusiast and founder of <a href="https://rhinolinux.org">Rhino Linux</a> and <a href="https://orbitalde.github.io">The Orbital Desktop Environment</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a software developer and information activist, I seek to promote accessible, reliable information about free and open source software in my blog posts and write-ups. I am 18 years old, and I am very passionate about computers and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            I first started learning website development in 2017 from school and fell in love with programming, from there I began to teach myself as much as I could. I was introduced to GNU/Linux and open source software in August 2020 and swapped from Windows 10 to Linux full-time in October 2020. I fell in love with open source software and the philosophy behind it.
